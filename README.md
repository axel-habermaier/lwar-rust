# lwar (Rust)

A Rust learning project with the eventual goal of porting [lwar](https://github.com/axel-habermaier/lwar) from C#/C++/C to Rust. Since this port uses native Win32 APIs and DirectX 11, it only runs and compiles on Windows.

As usual for my hobby projects, it's all about the learning experience, not about reaching some end goal (like a game that works and is fun to play...). So I try to avoid external libraries to increase my understanding for how things really work under the hood. The only exceptions so far are the Rust bindings to the Win32 API as well as DirectX 11.
